# London Bikes

## Aim of the Project
The aim of this project was threefold:
- To identify patterns in the spread of the number of bike shares in London.
- To evaluate the relationship between weather, time, and the number of bike shares.
- To assess whether a statistical model can predict the number of bike shares.

The data has been taken from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/hmavrodiev/london-bike-sharing-dataset) and spans over 2 years, from 2015 to 2017.

## Hardware Used
- MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015)
- Processor: 2.9 GHz Dual-Core Intel Core i5
- Memory: 8 GB 1867 MHz DDR3
- OS: macOS Catalina (version 10.15.3)

## File Descriptions
- preprocessing.ipynb: notebook for initial data cleaning, exploration, and analysis.
- modelling.ipynb: notebook for feature engineering, machine learning, and predictions.
- requirements.txt: includes a list of python libraries used in the project.
- data:
  - london_merged.csv: raw data file
